# This is my graduation project at Chas Academy.

It is an online shop where you can find and order knitted products of any kind. To facilitate your search, products can be filtered by categories and final users. You can choose a product in a relevant size and easily increase amount of products in your cart. Then you can specify your address and get instructions for payment. All orders, as well as a personal informaton, are saved in Your Profile, if you are a registered user, but you can also order items from the webshop without being registered or logged in.

There are users who have more rights than others, i.e. those who have Admin access specified in the database. They can create, update and delete sizes, categories and products in the shop's assortment. About us and Contact pages are available for everyone to make this webshop more personal and to let shop's creator and main administrator to get in touch with the users.

This project was made with Node Express Apollo Server with GraphQL on the backend and React Apollo Styled components with Material UI on the frontend, TypeScript both on FE and BE, PostgreSQL as a database solution and TypeORM to interact with it.
